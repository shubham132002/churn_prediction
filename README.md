## What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn, defined as customers discontinuing business with a company, is a common challenge in the telecom industry with an annual churn rate of 15-25%.
To address this, companies need to identify high-risk customers and focus retention efforts on them. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
Detecting early signs of churn requires a holistic view of customer interactions across channels. 
Success in this competitive market relies on reducing customer attrition and implementing effective retention strategies to expand coverage and increase profitability.
## Objectives:
Calculating the percentage of customers who have churned and those who continue to use active services.
Analyzing the data to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.
Identifying the most appropriate machine learning model for accurately classifying customers into churn and non-churn categories.
